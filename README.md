# Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web application for learning algorithms through step-by-step visual explanations. This project helps make abstract computer science concepts concrete and intuitive.

## 🔍 Overview

Algorithm Visualizer is designed to help users understand how various algorithms work through interactive visualizations. The platform covers:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort
- **Searching Algorithms**: Linear Search, Binary Search
- **Future Expansion**: Graph algorithms and data structure operations

Each algorithm includes:
- Step-by-step visualization
- Color-coded states to show comparisons, swaps, and progress
- Detailed pseudocode explanation
- Time and space complexity information
- Interactive controls for playback

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Controls**: Play, pause, step forward/back, and adjust animation speed
- **Color-coded Visualization**: See elements change as they're compared, swapped, and sorted
- **Algorithm Information**: Detailed explanations of how each algorithm works
- **Customizable Input**: Generate new arrays to see how algorithms handle different data
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Client-side Only**: Runs entirely in the browser with no server requirements
